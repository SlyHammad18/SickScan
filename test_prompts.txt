common cold:
I’ve been feeling unwell for the past few days. I have a runny and blocked nose, and I’m sneezing a lot. My throat feels sore and scratchy, especially in the morning. I also have a mild cough and feel tired most of the time. Sometimes I get a slight headache also. I also feel fever and chills

malaria:
I’ve been getting high fever that comes and goes. When the fever starts, I feel very cold and shiver a lot, and after some time I start sweating heavily. I have a bad headache, my whole body aches, and I feel extremely weak. I also feel nauseous and sometimes feel like vomiting.

diabaties:
I feel thirsty all the time and keep drinking water, but my mouth stays dry. I have to urinate very frequently, even at night. I feel tired and weak most of the day. I also feel very hungry, but I’m still losing weight. Sometimes my vision gets blurry, and small cuts or wounds take a long time to heal.
